# About the notebook

This notebook introduces Python as a calculator, including basic data types like int, float, str, bool, and list.  You'll learn about operations on these kinds of data, including arithmetic, boolean operations, and others.  

After working with Python as a calculator, the notebook introduces the "for loop" as a tool for repetetive computation.  Explorations include the approximation of square roots, e, and pi.
